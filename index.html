         <h3> When I Am Not Coding</h3> 
         <p> I have a background in art and social work and a passion for logic, math, and patterns.
              I'm lucky enough to be based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I am looking forward to finding a position in web development that fosters a growth mindset and working with other developers.</p>
         <p> When I am not coding, you can find me handweaving on my 8-shaft Kessenech floor loom (Fun fact:<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/09/before-computers-people-programmed-looms/380163/">The first computer programs were inspired by looms!</a>), dreaming up my next adventure to a remote corner of the world, or laughing with good friends.</p>

      <h3>Web Weavers Studio</h3>
      <p>Web Weavers Studio is a fullstack CRUD app that provides users with the opportunity to create and maintain a list of weaving projects. Users can track data on their personal projects along with seeing data on other's projects.</p>
      <p>Handweaving is a craft that has been passed down by women and men in in person studios and homes for generations. As the people start aging out of the craft, the app intends tor replace some of the in person knowledge sharing by providing users with quick data on projects. Additionally, keeping track of data on personal projects can be daunting as well, so having one place to log projects will simplify notetaking.</p>
